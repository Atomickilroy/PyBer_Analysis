###  **Purpose of the New Analysis** 


 The purpose of this new an analysis was to prensent a chart that not only showed a comparison of city types, or specific city performance but to demenostrate the the flow of avg fare data over time.
 
 The inital report was a good representation for understanding the " *bread and butter* " of Pyber is the revenue generated from Urban areas and seeing the data from specific cities. Such as:

![Boston Line Chart](https://github.com/Atomickilroy/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/Module%205%20Skill%20Drills/MATHLAB%20Line.png)

 
 
 
  Yet no one chart was able to demonstrate the combined average of the key metrics: 
 - Fares
 - Drivers
 - City Type 
 - Over Time
